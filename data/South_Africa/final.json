After completing her standard 10 (now grade 12) at Mshadza High School, she worked as a temporary teacher at Mganduzweni High School from 1980-81. Passionate about education and self advancement, she enrolled for a financial secretariat diploma with Phonefficiency in Johannesburg while residing in Tembisa on the East Rand. Mashego-Dlamini changed professions when she did a Secondary Teachers’ Diploma (STD) at the Elijah Mango College of Education, which was a breeding ground for political activities. She further pursued a BA degree, after which she read for a B.Ed degree in Education Management and went on to attain a Diploma in Public Management. These qualifications were attained through the University of South Africa. She holds a string of certificates, including Environmental Management, Fidelity Fund, Basic Computer, typing and Music. Currently, she is studying towards a Masters degree in Public Management. Mashego-Dlamini played an instrumental role in setting up a Detainee parents Support Committee in the 1980s to thwart the impact of the arrests of many anti-apartheid activists. She participated in many structures including the National Education Union of SA, which spearheaded the formation of the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU). In 1994, her political immersion in bread and butter issues of the oppressed saw her elevated to becoming MEC for Health, Welfare and Gender Affairs. In 1999, she was appointed MEC for Agriculture, Conservation and Environment, a position she held until she was given the responsibility to lead the Department of Public Works from 2004 to 2007.\r\n\r\nMs Mashego-Dlamini is the Deputy Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform since 26 May 2014.

      "summary": "Amos Masondo was born on the 21 April 1953 in Soweto. He was the Mayor of the City of Johannesburg, South Africa, between 2001 and 2011. He is a member of the African National Congress, and was the first elected mayor of the Unified City of Johannesburg. He also established underground Umkhonto we Sizwe cells in Soweto, and was imprisoned on Robben Island from 1975 to 1981 for his participation in anti-apartheid activities. After he was released, he served as a member of the Soweto Civic Association, and was again detained under the emergency regulations from June 1985 to March 1986, and again from July 1986 to 1989. He was also elected as a member of the Gauteng Legislature, and was subsequently elected to serve as Mayor of Johannesburg in 2001. Mr Masondo was also a founding member of the United Democratic Front, a broad non-racial coalition against apartheid. On his release in 1989, he became regional secretary for COSATU, the trade union umbrella organisation and the ANC’s regional election coordinator. \r\nMasondo was longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award.[citation needed]. source: [citymayors.com](http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/johannesburg-mayor.html \"bio\")"
