We no longer include 'lang__xx' names if identical to 'lang__en' for
Groups/Parties or Elections.

The term-by-term CSV files now have an extra `wikidata` column to
reflect the Wikidata ID for the member, where known.

To reduce data bloat, we will no longer be including 'lang__xx' data where that
is identical to 'lang__en'.

This currently only applies to Areas, but will be applied to other
collections over time.

Other language fallback chains may be implemented later.
